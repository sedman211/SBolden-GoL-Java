Instructions and general info for running this java simulation.

ConwaySim.java was created using Eclipse IDE, and contains its own main method.
This means that it 'should' work with any decent java compiler that can execute
the program. You should have the java SDK installed, as well as the java PATH set 
up in the computer's system properties just in case.

Each live cell in the game is represented by a 'O', while each dead cell is
represented by a '_' to make it visually simple.

When the program is run, you have to enter 4 values:

Number of rows
Number of columns
Seed number
Continuous generation (Y/N)

The user can enter any number of rows and columns for the game. The seed value
specifies how many times a random cell in the grid will be changed from '0' (Dead)
to '1' (Alive). I set it up this way because I didn't find a quick way of setting
specific cells to alive in the game. Lastly, continuous generation can be set to either
'Y' or 'N', which will make the game continue once, or generate every 2 seconds until the
program is killed by the user. All of this is a work-in-progress.
